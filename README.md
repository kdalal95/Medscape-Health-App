# Medscape Health App

#### • A Machine Learning Web App created with Flask deployed on Heroku platform.
#### • Do ⭐ the repository if it helped you in anyway.
#### • Webapp link: https://medscape-healthapp.herokuapp.com/

## Overview

In todays time we see a lot of the shortage of the doctors in the world especially in India. A lot of people are suffering a lot without the help of the proper medical checkup.
Mobile devices and apps provide many benefits for medical care professionals, perhaps most significantly increased access to point-of-care tools, which has been shown to support better clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes

We have built this webapp "Medscape App" to help clinicians identify the appropriate scans or tests to order, decreasing unnecessary procedures and reducing cost of care. You can diagnose the following health conditions :

• Breast Cancer
• Diabetes
• Heart Condition
• Liver Condition
• Kidney Condition

## Application

• To remove the dependencies on the doctors.
• For better clinical decision-making.
• To improve accuracy of diagnosis.
• To increase efficiency of medical care professionals.
• To enhance productivity of clinicians.

## Data Source Description

The datasets used for model development are available on kaggle.com

## Model Selection

To fit the data, the classification models that we wish to compare are Logistic Regression, KNN and Random Forest Classifier. I have split the entire data frame into 80% Training Set and 20% Test set, where I hold out the Test Set for final model evaluation. 
Using the models with best score I have further deployed the app.

## Future Work

We can add some more disease in the app which requires image data of X-Ray like Covid, Pneumonia and so on.
